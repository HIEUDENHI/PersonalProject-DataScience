# PersonalProject - DataScience

## Introduction

This project aims to build a linear regression model using the OLS method while experimenting with different sets of features to find the best model (i.e., the one with the lowest MAE).

## Project Steps

- **Class Construction:**  
  Build a class from scratch (we are not allowed to use any external library) to implement the regression model.

- **Data Visualization:**  
  Visualize feature distributions using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand the relationships among features and the target variable, and assess the impact of each feature on the target.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Create new features by combining or transforming existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power.

- **Model Training:**  
  Train the model using k-fold cross-validation to robustly evaluate its performance.

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  Identify the best model by testing on a separate test set and comparing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## What I learned from this project
This project is goodâ€”it helped me understand the math behind linear regression instead of just using libraries. The aspects of model training and cross-validation were things I had learned before this course, so there wasn't much new.

The project dataset was quite "clean" and simple, so I didn't need to do much preprocessing. Anyway, I got a 9 in this project :)))
